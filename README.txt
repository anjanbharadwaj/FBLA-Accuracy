INTRODUCTION

Our website is designed to cater to all the needs of a fictional Accuracy Accounting Firm. 
Right from the get-go, our website catches a customer's eyes with a flash animation of an 
arrow perfectly hitting a dartboard - signifying our undying devotion toward perfection and
precision. As users scroll through our website, we hope they will be invited to explore due 
to our elegant UI and fluid UX. With a focus on material design and beauty, we have painstakingly 
iterated upon each and every design (taking survey data from students in our FBLA chapter) until we 
found the perfect site. Our website culminates in an easy to use, personalized, dashboard were 
customers can view real-time information about the performance of their firm or account 
(such as liabilities, profits, and sales). We hope you enjoy our website and we hope to 
get the chance to speak with you at SLC!

A: Make sure your password is over 6 characters and your username has an email provider attached (ex @gmail.com)

Q: Where is the code for the game?
A: The code in the game should be viewable from the 3D Player (not the zip) included in the project submission.
